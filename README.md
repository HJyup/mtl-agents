# MTL-Agents

MTL-Agents is a web application that allows you to interact with multiple agents at once.

## Idea

I was really inspired by the idea that we can use agents as ai assistants in our daily lives. I wanted to try to create loads of new projects using them but instead of creating a new one for each idea, I made a single project that can act as a sandbox for all my agent ideas.

## Available Agents

- [X] Google Calendar
- [ ] Google Mail
- [ ] Notion
- [X] Things
- [ ] University
- [ ] *FST Agent (planned) (I have a project where I recreated Git from strach and I want to make an agent that can help you navigating through this)*

## Installation


First, set up the environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```


Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
