# MTL-Agents

MTL-Agents is a web application that allows you to interact with multiple agents at once.

## Idea

I was really inspired by the idea that we can use agents as ai assistants in our daily lives. I wanted to try to create loads of new projects using them but instead of creating a new one for each idea, I made a single project that can act as a sandbox for all my agent ideas.

## Available Agents

- [X] Google Calendar
- [ ] Google Mail
- [ ] Notion
- [X] Things
- [ ] University
- [ ] *FST Agent (planned) (I have a project where I recreated Git from strach and I want to make an agent that can help you navigating through this)*

You can choose them using shortcut that indetifies agent (for example for google calendar it's `cl`)

## Context
All agents share the same conversational context. For example, if youâ€™re chatting with ChatGPT and then decide to create a new to-do list via the Things agent, it can automatically reference your previous messages for improved context and understanding.

## Exmaple
Small example how it works
